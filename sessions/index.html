            <div class="schedule-abstract">
              <p>Nearly 40 years ago, Leslie Lamport wrote the seminal work "Time, Clocks and the Ordering of Events in a Distributed System". Ever since then academia and industry have been struggling with the implications of this sentence: "In a distributed system, it is sometimes impossible to say that one of two events occurred first."</p>
              <p>(Of course, Albert Einstein didn't need Lamport to point that out.)</p>
              <p>If the fundamental laws of physics stand in our way, what can we do to track causality?</p>
              <p>Among other topics we'll discuss Lamport timestamps, CRDTs, NTP, and databases. Expect the dreaded concept of "eventual consistency" to rear its head. Often.</p>
              <p>Attendees are expected to have an inquisitive mind, but no other prerequisites are required. You should not expect to come away with any packaged solutions to your problems, but you'll have a greater awareness of the pitfalls you'll face as distributed systems become the norm in this era of mobile computing, cloud computing, and big data.</p>

              <p>A child that wants to become a software engineer today faces a myriad of challenges that were not present 30 years ago. These challenges are discouraging the next generation from pursuing careers in technology. This talk will walk you through the journey of a what it takes to become a software engineer.</p>
              <p>We will be breaking down the societal, educational and pop culture influences that steer a child closer or further from a career in technology. We'll examine snapshots of critical moments in the lives of a boy and a girl, starting at age 5 until age 35.  We'll spend some time explaining what these trends mean for the technology industry and world culture both today and in the future. If you are not comfortable with our current trajectory, I'll discuss effective ways to change it.</p>
              <p>Software is a rewarding and booming field. Come find out what is stopping your child from being a part of it.</p>

            <div class="schedule-abstract">
              <p>We have complex, challenging problems when we implement our UI. If that wasn't hard enough, there's a myriad of good and bad ways to write our JavaScript-and it keeps evolving! ES6 is here, ES7 is showing up, and guess what, those are now called ES2015, ES2016, and there will be a 17, 18, 19...</p>
              <p>Fortunately, there is also a revolution in JavaScript tooling. New tools are here to help us understand and improve our code. Let's look at one of these tools, ESLint, and peek under the hood! But first, let's rediscover how languages are parsed, analyzed, and represented as abstract syntax trees.</p>
              <p>During this session, we'll learn to reason about ASTs to detect good and bad patterns in computer language. To drive this home, we'll build our own tools including custom rules for ESLint.</p>

              <p>Technical operations is plagued with an unhealthy infatuation of typically untested, imperative code with a high reliance on shared mutable state using dynamically typed languages such as Ruby, Python, Bash, and - ugh - remember Perl? :)</p>
              <p>In an age where building reliable infrastructure to elastically scale applications and services are paramount to business success, we need to start rethinking the infrastructure engineer’s toolkit and guiding principles.</p>
              <p>This talk will take a look at applying various declarative and functional techniques to building and automating infrastructure. From functional package management and congruent configuration to declarative cloud provisioning we’ll see just how practical these techniques typically used in functional programming for applications can be used to help build more robust and predictable infrastructures.</p>
              <p>While specific code examples will be offered, the emphasis of this talk will be on guiding principles.</p>

            <div class="schedule-name">How to Write a Worthwhile Test</div>
            <div class="schedule-abstract">
              <p>Open a test at random. Answer:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Why does it exist?</li>
                <li>What is under test?</li>
                <li>How does it explain edge cases?</li>
                <li>What real things does it replace with fake things?</li>
                <li>What can cause the test to fail?</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Unless the answers to those questions are obvious, no one has any clue whether the test is worthwhile. But the murkiness of most test code drives teams to ritualize its upkeep. When tests glow red, generous sacrifices are offered until they turn green again. Over time, faith in the Agile Church of Testing has eroded. Dogma that "thou shalt test" now rings hollow.</p>
              <p>Epic tomes have been written on the theory of sound testing, but their detached wisdom rarely survives contact with actual projects. Our understanding becomes muddied as we mangle our tests under the pressure to get things working and features out the door.</p>
              <p>This talk will clear the waters by presenting a guideline for testing: a set of sensible defaults to be adopted and tweaked for your own projects. Each rule will be easy-to-follow, promote consistency, and backed by deeper reasoning available to anyone who seeks it. By planting a shared guidepost, everyone on a team or in a community—from novices to experts—will be better-equipped to write tests that can be plainly understood by others.</p>

            <div class="schedule-abstract">
              <p>We are all familiar with the standard tedious method of learning new programming languages: "hello world", then some builtin functions, then basic data types, etc, ad naseum. But what if we could turn the process of learning a new language into an addictive game.</p>
              <p>In this talk I will introduce you to the make-a-lisp process (the game) and show how its structure enables Charles Coonradt's 5 principles of gamification: defined goals, scorekeeping, frequent feedback, personal choice of methods, and consistent coaching. I hope to convince you that gamification of the learning process, and specifically the make-a-lisp process, is one of the most effective and efficient ways to learn new programming languages. Or at least I hope I will have convinced you to try out the "game".</p>

              <p>Databases were traditionally designed to operate on CRUD apps. With the explosion of data in early 2000s, the whole NoSQL movement was born to allow web-scale CRUD operations.</p>
              <p>However with the emergence of the #realtimeweb, database designs find themselves broken yet again. IoT is fundamentally transforming the data processing needs from hours and minutes to mini and μ-second scales.</p>
              <p>Appbase.io is building the first streaming DB, for the most performance intensive data processing needs. The role of data and queries is fundamentally reversed here - Queries are always indexed and data is treated as a fast changing incoming stream to be matched against queries.</p>
              <p>In this talk, I would like to introduce the concept of streaming DBs, and go over an open-source implementation where we have integrated this interface into ElasticSearch. We are able to scale this to over 100,000 documents per second over just 12 c4.2xlarge EC2 instances. I would also like to cover the use-cases we are seeing in IoT, e-commerce, travel, consumer apps space; and how "streaming" will influence database designs over the coming years.</p>

              <p>In the new Cooper-Hewitt museum in NYC there was a display about the <a href="http://fffff.at/free-universal-construction-kit/">Free Universal Construction Kit</a>, an abstraction around most popular building toys like Lego, Tinkertoy, K'nex, and Lincoln Logs, made possible by 3D printing.<p>
              <p>This incredible toy can help inspire even the most advanced developers for how we think about abstractions in our applications, building technology agnostic services. We'll talk about POSIX stdin/stdout, Google's protobufs, JSON, and other data serialization formats and protocols.</p>
              <p>This talk will be somewhat high level. While we'll write some code, it's about getting to the core of computer science: thinking abstractly as opposed to digging into a single specific technology.</p>
              <p>This talk should appeal to developers of any ability. Many of us grew up in systems of construction toys, building cities merging our Lego and our Fishertechnik. As adults we live in a similar world, often building systems in walled gardens and needing new ways to break down the barriers and rethink our perspectives on programming.</p>

            <div class="schedule-abstract">
              <p>The "onload" event no longer matters. Single Page Applications are a problem when trying to measure page load performance because there aren’t easy ways to tell when a new "page load" has been requested as a result of an intentional user action, or when all of the resource fetches triggered by that action have completed.</p>
              <p>Even with requests that are initiated by a user action, not all may fit into the definition of a “page view”. For example, a user typing into a search box that has auto-complete capabilities will often result in network requests, but these requests result in very small amounts of data transfer, happen very frequently, and do not count towards page-views.</p>
              <p>The scene is further complicated by the variety of SPA frameworks like AngularJS, Backbone.js, Ember.js and others.</p>
              <p>In this talk, we’ll learn about some of the tricks used by boomerang to measure the performance of single page applications, going as far as capturing errors and waterfall information across browsers.</p>

            <div class="schedule-abstract">
              <p>It can be a struggle to translate the details of a design vision into the browser. Creating bitmap images, icons, and graphics can be time consuming and result in inconsistency and difficulty with managing updates. Scalable vector graphics (SVGs) might be just what you're looking for.</p>
              <p>SVGs are now supported on every modern browser and mobile device, and usage is on the upswing, but most people only use them for icons. Most developers and designers don’t realize how powerful and useful SVGs are. From scalable images to full-blown web applications, SVGs fit many needs.</p>
              <p>In this session:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>I will discuss the importance of understanding the capabilities of SVGs and how developers and designers can improve the quality of designs created in the browser.</li>
                <li>Through an understanding of SVG capabilities you will know how each layer of Illustrator is rendered through SVGs in the browser.</li>
                <li>You won’t learn about SVG font icons; you WILL learn about how to efficiently export SVGs so your team won’t curse your name. With SVGs you can render each design layer directly in the browser.</li>
                <li>Apply filters, lighting effects, gaussian blur, and animations, all directly through the use of this file format. Get exactly what you want in the browser.</li>

            <div class="schedule-abstract">
              <p>Development practices for distributed systems promise the benefits of both flexibility and velocity, but confidence enables those benefits.  As these systems evolve, they exceed the ability of any single human to mentally model.  The future of software is complex, increasingly opaque even to the engineers building it.  We can no longer rely on an architect to reason about these systems.  If we can’t reason about them, how can we have confidence in them?</p>
              <p>An empirical, systems-based approach is needed to build confidence. We learn about the behavior of a distributed system by observing and experimenting on the system as it runs in production. We call this Chaos Engineering.</p>
              <p>Chaos Engineering is a powerful practice that is already changing how software is designed and engineered at some of the largest-scale operations in the world.  Where other practices address velocity and flexibility, Chaos specifically tackles systemic uncertainty in these distributed systems.  The Principles of Chaos provide confidence to innovate quickly at massive scales and give customers the high quality experiences they deserve.</p>
              <p>Engineers and architects will walk away from this talk with an appreciation for complexity in distributed systems, and excited about this new approach to building confidence on top of that complexity.</p>

            <div class="schedule-abstract">
              <p>The performance of your application affects your business more than you might think. Top engineering organizations think of performance not as a nice-to-have, but as a crucial feature of their product. Unfortunately, most engineering teams do not regularly test the performance and scalability of their infrastructure. Dustin Whittle shares the latest techniques and tools for performance testing modern web and mobile applications. Join this session and learn how to capacity plan and evaluate performance and the scalability of the server-side through Siege, Bees with Machine Guns, and Locust.io. We will dive into modern performance testing on the client-side and how to leverage navigation/resource timing apis and tools like Google PageSpeed and SiteSpeed.io to understand the real world performance of your users. We will cover how HTTP2 and modern browsers change the game for performance optimization with new best practices. Take back an understanding of how to automate performance and load testing and evaluate the impact it has on performance and your business.</p>

            <div class="schedule-abstract">
              <p>Modern browsers include their own flavor of development tools (Chrome DevTools, Firebug, IE's Developer Tools, etc.) that are excellent for speeding up webapp development and debugging common issues. But what if you had custom, in-browser tools that were tailored for developing and debugging your application?</p>
              <p>Every webapp has concerns of its own that generic tools don't address. Perhaps you've dug through custom HTML attributes for entity IDs to diagnose a database issue. Or maybe you've searched the codebase for CSS class names in hope of finding some clue as to what code generated a piece of HTML.</p>
              <p>In this session, learn how you can combine browser extensions and on-page scripts to create rich, custom tools to improve your development and support workflows. We'll get into specifics with an approach that involves writing a custom Chrome extension and using an iframe-based fallback for cross-browser support. This session assumes at least intermediate JavaScript knowledge.</p>

              <p>Data visualization lives in the intersection of art and science.  Designing compelling visuals reveals information about our systems, and in turn allows us to ask new and more interesting questions.  However knowing how to find the stories in our data is hard and knowing how to tell those story visually is even harder.</p>
              <p>In this talk we'll explore some historical data visualization techniques and best practices and show how we can use modern tools to implement them.</p>

            <div class="schedule-abstract">
              <p>Searching for similar strings is harder than it sounds. Variations in formatting and misspellings make exact matches impossible and there are many different similarity functions to choose from. This talk is about the development of a fast custom index for fuzzy name matching.</p>
              <p>This is a technical talk that will interest anyone who wants to see an example of bit level optimization being used in practice. Name matching has applications in record linkage, de-duplication, and fraud detection.
